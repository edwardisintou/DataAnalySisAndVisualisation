# CITS 2401 Computer Analysis and Visualisation

## Project 2: Visualising Data Traffic in Smart Cars

### 36/50 D

### Outline
In this project, we will continue from our Project 1 where we implemented an intrusion detection system (IDS). But instead of implementing the features (which we completed in Project 1), we will now focus on data analysis and visualisation skills to better present what our datasets contain. For this project, you will be given several datasets that contain smart car sensor readings and network traffic that are already labelled normal or attack. Your task is to perform the following steps (more details in the tasks section):
- Data analysis
- Data visualisation
- Write data analysis and visualisation report
- (bonus) use machine learning to implement IDS
- Peer marking

### Task 1: Data Analysis using NumPy
You must demonstrate at least 5 NumPy related skills for data analysis. This may include NumPy
functions and methods, matrix manipulations, vectorized computations, NumPy statistics, NumPy where function, etc. The more variety of skills demonstrated would equate to the fluency of data analysis.

For example, if you wrote a data analysis code that leads to the same output, we will consider that as NOT being a different approach to achieving the outcomes. If you only slightly modify the code to get different outputs (e.g., changing the axes value), it will not give you full marks (i.e., it would be considered as a variation to the original solution you presented).

### Task 2: Data Visualisation using matplotlib
You must demonstrate at least 5 matplotlib related skills for data visualisation. These can be line/bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, heatmaps, etc. The presentation of the visualisations (e.g., customising labels, points etc.) will determine your fluency in data visualisation skills. You should also note that the data you visualise should be meaningful (i.e., you need to provide discussions about the data you have visualised).

For example, changing the line colour will NOT be considered as a different data visualisation skill. Changing the regression model from linear to cubic will only be considered as a minor change (i.e., it would be considered as a variation to the original solution you presented) and will not give you full marks.

### Task 3: Write a summary report
Write a summary report for your data analysis and visualisation. The report presents your findings and recommendations using the above data analysis and visualisation techniques and articulate your understanding of the datasets. You should clearly explain your motive (i.e., why did you do this data analysis and/or visualisation?), methodology (how), and results (what), and discuss the capabilities of your IDS based on your analysis.

There is no specific format or page/word limits, but a good (HD-grade) report does not necessarily be the longest nor in the most professional format (i.e., quality over quantity, and you need a good balance between the two).

At the very end of the report, you must also add an appendix to include your source code.

* Note: Ensure to include your student ID in the report! NO NAME NO MARKS!

### Task 4 (Bonus): Apply machine learning techniques
Research and build an intrusion detection model using machine learning (ML). You can implement a MLbased IDS, such as logistic regression, decision tree, or neural network, to classify the data into normal or attack categories. You should also split the data into training and testing sets, train your model, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Add a section in your report about using ML techniques for IDS, including visualisations.

* Final remarks: make sure you have the module docstring for your project code, indicating your name, your student ID number along with the description of the project.

### Task 5: Peer marking

Project 2 will involve peer-marking: you will be asked to mark 3 other reports assigned to you for the data analysis (20 marks), visualisation (20 marks) and coding style (10 marks), a total of 50 marks. This is a failed component task (i.e., you must complete this task to pass the project).

#### Rules
- You must mark the reports according to the rubrics shown in section 4 below for data analysis and visualisation components (marking out of 40), and the coding style (marking out of 10). A total of 50 marks can be given to a report.
- You may also award bonus marks if it exists in the report, with the maximum mark of 5.
- Giving poor/high marks will be flagged and may be deemed as task 5 incomplete, so mark genuinely following the rubrics!
- You must mark ALL three allocated reports.
- Your mark remains zero (0) until you complete all three peer markings.
- Your mark remains zero (0) if you conduct rule (3) intentionally.
